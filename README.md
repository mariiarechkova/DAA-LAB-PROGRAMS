# 💡 Design and Analysis of Algorithms – Lab Programs (23CS253)

This repository contains Java/C/C++ implementations of the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms Lab (DAA Lab)** as per the VTU syllabus (CAMBRIDGE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, Semester IV). It includes a wide range of algorithmic strategies like **Brute Force, Divide and Conquer, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, and Backtracking**.

## 🧪 Lab Structure & Syllabus Overview

Each program is associated with real-world problem statements and focuses on:

- Algorithm design strategies (CO1)
- Problem-solving via programming (CO2)
- Time complexity analysis and empirical comparison (CO3)
