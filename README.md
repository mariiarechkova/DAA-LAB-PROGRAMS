Welcome to the **DAA-LAB-PROGRAMS** repository! This project provides a complete Java implementation of lab exercises from the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course (Course Code: 23CS253). It aligns with the VTU syllabus and covers a range of algorithm strategies including brute-force, divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming, and backtracking. 

You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/mariiarechkova/DAA-LAB-PROGRAMS/releases). Each release includes the code, problem statements, and performance analysis plots.

## Algorithms Covered

This repository includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- **Brute Force**: Simple and straightforward solutions to problems, focusing on exhaustive search.
- **Divide and Conquer**: Algorithms that break a problem into smaller subproblems, solve them independently, and combine the results.
  - **Merge Sort**: A sorting algorithm that divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.
  - **Quick Sort**: A fast sorting algorithm that selects a 'pivot' and partitions the array around it.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Algorithms that make the locally optimal choice at each stage.
  - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: A method for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.
  - **Prim's Algorithm**: Another method for finding the minimum spanning tree, focusing on connecting nodes.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Techniques for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.
  - **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: A method for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights.
- **Backtracking**: A method for solving problems incrementally, by trying partial solutions and abandoning them if they fail to satisfy the conditions.
  - **N-Queens Problem**: A classic problem of placing N queens on a chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.
  - **Sudoku Solver**: A program that solves Sudoku puzzles using backtracking.

## How to Run the Programs

To run any program, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the specific algorithm you want to run. For example, to run MergeSort:

```bash
cd brute_force/
```

2. Compile the Java file:

```bash
javac Problem1.java
```

3. Run the compiled Java program:

```bash
java Problem1
```

Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Java website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

## Performance Analysis

Each algorithm comes with performance analysis plots that illustrate their efficiency. These plots compare execution times and memory usage for various input sizes. You can find these plots in the respective directories for each algorithm.
